*See the project's poster presentation [here](https://donald-dinerman.github.io/Undergraduate-Research/)*.

We worked with Carnegie Mellon's Statistics Advising
team to create data-backed insights that will support
advising recommendations.

Our dataset includes anonymized course performance data for 
CMU Statistics & Data Science graduates from 2016 to 2020.

We designed predictive models using random forests 
that take in students' academic history and predicts 
their future course performance.

We also created interactive graphs and tables
to visualize course grade distributions, comparative 
course performance, course retake performance along with 
other metrics.

Lastly, we built a Shiny App to host predictive modeling
and exploratory data analysis. Advisors can freely interact
with the app and extract insights at their discretion.

Given dependency complications with hosting the app on a
non-local server and privacy constraints with student
information, a poster presentation will be displayed in
place of the app.
