We worked with Carnegie Mellon's Statistics Adivising
team to create data-backed insights that will support
advising recommendations.

We designed a predictive model using random forests 
that takes in a student's academic history and predicts 
their future course performance.

Our dataset includes course performance data
over the past 6 years for CMU undergraduates
in the Statistics Department.
