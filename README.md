We worked with Carnegie Mellon's Statistics Adivising
team to create data-backed insights that will support
advising recommendations.

Our dataset includes anonymized course performance data for 
CMU Statistics & Data Science graduates from 2016 to 2020.

We designed predictive models using random forests 
that take in students' academic history and predicts 
their future course performance.

We also created interactive graphs and tables
to visualize course grade distributions, comparative 
course performance, course retake performance along with 
other metrics.

Lastly, we built a Shiny App to host the predictive modeling
and exploratory data analysis. Advisors can freely interact
with the app and extract insights at their discretion.
